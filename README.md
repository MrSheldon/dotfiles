# dotfiles
These are my "dotfiles" used on UNIX systems for use with :
* Vim
* Zsh
* Git

# Installation

Clone a copy of the repo into your home folder.

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/bwmarrin/dotfiles.git
```

Now link the dotfiles into your home folder.

```
cd ~
ln -s dotfiles/.* .
```

That's it.
